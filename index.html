            <p class="normal_p">My name is Burak Gunduz, and I am a first-generation university scholar reading Aerospace Engineering at Queen's University Belfast. 
                My coding journey started whilst completing a summer research internship at the University of Oxford. 
                I was taught Python as part of a data science course before starting my research project in the Department of Materials. 
                From that point onwards, I taught myself HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, C++, and Ruby. I love solving complex problems and learning about new technology. 
                 <br><br>In my free time, I like to write and publish articles on Medium about engineering, technology, productivity, and entrepreneurship.</p>

            <h3>Undergraduate Research Internship</h3>
            <p class="lang">Languages: Python and MATLAB</p>
            <p class="normal_p">I had the opportunity to participate in an intensive data science course that covered Python's libraries such as NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib and how they can be utilised to analyse and present data. Furthermore, I learned the basics of object-oriented programming. Additionally, I received training in UNIX, Git and learnt good version control practices. To solidify my knowledge, I had to solve problem sets, which got progressively more complex. 
                Throughout the research part of the internship, I used MATLAB.</p>

            <h2>Queen's University Belfast</h2>
            <h3>Electrical and Electronic Engineering Project</h3>
            <p class="lang">Language: C++</p>
            <p class="normal_p">The objective was to design a microcontroller unit application capable of being turned ON and OFF by a pushbutton switch. 
                Furthermore, the LDR sensor in the circuit had to detect ambient light by an analog input signal. 
                Then using that information, the system was able to control the LED brightness using PWM signal in the full range. 
                I coded the system using C++ on Mbed. I received a first-class grade of 95% on this project.</p>

            <h3>Front-End Engineer Course</h3>
            <p class="lang">Languages: HTML5, CCS3, JavaScript, and Ruby</p>
            <p class="normal_p">I completed the Front-End Engineer course, covering HTML5, CCS3, and JavaScript (jQuery, React, Redux.) I also learnt the basics of data structures and algorithms. This course was my introduction to front-end development. Following this course, I decided to learn Ruby due to its dynamic and general-purpose nature. My future objective is to develop my understanding of the fundamentals behind computer science. </p>
